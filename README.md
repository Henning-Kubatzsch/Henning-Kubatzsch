### 💡 About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer with a background in computer science and a deep interest in large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP).

I've rebuilt GPT from scratch, completed Karpathy’s makemore series on character-level language models, and am currently working on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using custom data.

I enjoy learning deeply, thinking clearly, and building things that matter.

### 🔧 What I've Worked On

- 🧠 **Let's build GPT** – Built a full Transformer from scratch, including tokenization, attention, and autoregression  
- 🧱 **makemore** – Character-level language models, initialization, BatchNorm, optimization techniques  
- 📚 **Notebook Archive** – My personal training notes & tutorials in [Colab/Jupyter](#)  
- 🔍 **RAG Prototype** (Work in progress) – Embeddings, search, and retrieval on private datasets

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I love understanding complex models by working through them with pen and paper. Seriously.
