### 💡 About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer with a CS background and a deep interest in large language models (LLMs), NLP, and explainable ML systems.

I rebuild things from first principles, write clean, tested code, and enjoy contributing to tools I use.

### 🛠️ Open Source

Actively contributing to [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [Cohere](https://github.com/cohere-ai) and other LLM-related libraries.  
Focus: SDK compatibility, tool integrations, and test coverage.
