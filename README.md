### 💡 About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer with a CS background and a deep focus on **LLMs, NLP, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  
I build things from the ground up, write **tested and maintainable code**, and continuously push myself to understand systems in depth — not just use them.

### 🛠️ Open Source

Contributions and learning in the LLM ecosystem:  

* [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) – SDK compatibility & integration tests  
* [Cohere](https://github.com/cohere-ai) – tooling and usability improvements  
* Other experiments around embeddings, retrievers, and model serving

---

### 📚 Current Projects

* 🔍 **Agentic RAG System** – Modular pipeline with embeddings, HNSW index, retriever, prompts, and streaming API (FastAPI)  
  → focus on **efficiency, modularity, and test-driven development**  
* 🧠 **Let's Build GPT** – Transformer from scratch: tokenization, attention, autoregression  
* 🧱 **makemore (Karpathy)** – character-level LMs, batchnorm, optimizations  
* 🗒️ **ML Notebook Archive** – notes, demos, experiments

---

### 🧭 Interests

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & evaluation  
* Efficient local inference (CPU/MPS optimizations, Docker later)  
* ML for education & explainability  
* Writing clean, modular, and well-tested Python  
* Bridging research ideas with usable systems

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I’m currently building a full RAG pipeline from scratch —  
and writing **unit tests for every module** to sharpen my Python engineering skills.


### ⚡ Fun Fact

I enjoy understanding machine learning from first principles — sometimes that means grabbing a pen and doing the math.
